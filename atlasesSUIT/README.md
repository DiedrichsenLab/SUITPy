## Cerebellar Atlases 

The SUIT toolbox provides a collection of anatomical and functional atlases of the human cerebellum. The atlases are provided as NIFTI-volumes aligned to SUIT space. In the flatmap directory, we have also included  GIFTI-files for display on the cerebellar flat map. The atlases can also be downloaded as a standalone from the website as Nift-volumes in MNI-spaces (FNIRT). 

See also our online cerebellar atlas tool for quick reference! 

#### Probabilistic atlas of cerebellar lobules: Diedrichsen et al. (2009).
The anatomical definitions are based on the fMRI atlas of an individual cerebellum by Schmahmann et al. (2000). We manually identified the main lobules on MRI scans of 20 healthy young participants (ROIs 1-28). Using a different set of 23 participants, we also identified the deep cerebellar nuclei (ROIs 29-34).

#### Task free parcellation: Buckner et al. (2011) 
Buckner et al. (2011) presented the first comprehensive functional atlas of the human cerebellum, based on the correlation of each cerebellar voxel and with cortical resting state networks. based on the data from 1000 subjects. A parcellation of 7 and 17 regions is available.

#### Task free parcellation: Ji et al. (2019)

Ji et al. (2019) presented a parcellation of subcortical structures based on correlation with 10 cortical networks, based on the HCP resting state data.

#### Multi-domain task battery (MDTB) parcellation: King et al. (2019)

King et al. (2019) provided an extensive characterization of the functional organization of the cerebellum, by collecting data from 47 task conditions in 24 healthy, young participants. Based on the the task data, a parcellation of the cerebellum in 7, 10, or 17 regions was supplied.

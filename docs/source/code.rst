Flatmap Module
**************************
	
As part of the SUIT toolbox, we have developed a flat representation of the human cerebellum that can be used to visualise imaging data after volume-based normalisation and averaging across subjects. 
To explore the flatmap in more detail, check out our online cerebellar atlas viewer at http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/AtlasViewer/index.html.

SUITPy Documentation
====================
SUITPy is a Python toolbox dedicated to the analysis of imaging data of the human cerebellum. It provides a subset og the original Matlab version of the SUIT toolbox for Matlab (https://github.com/jdiedrichsen/suit).
Currently, only mapping of volume data to the flatmap and display of the flatmap are implemented.

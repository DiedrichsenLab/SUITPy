Reslice Module
===============

The reslice module of the SUITPy toolbox is used to bring images into Atlas space. The required inputs are a list of source images, an nonlinear deformation file (y_xxx.nii), interpolation (trilinear or nearest neighbor), and affine matrix. In addition, it allows users to input mask image that only show particular area. Also, voxel size and image shape can be defined by users.

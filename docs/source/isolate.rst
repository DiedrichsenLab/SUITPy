Isolation Module
================

The isolation module of the SUIT toolbox uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network to isolate the cerebellum and brainstem from the rest of the head. The network was trained on manually labelled anatomical images from a wide range of studies, scanners and acquisition protocols. The network is based on the U-Net architecture and implemented using the Pytorch package. The network was developed by Yao Li with supervision from Carlos Hernandez-Castillo and JÃ¶rn Diedrichsen.

architecture
----------
Here is the overall Unet architecture

The model takes 2 input channels which are filled with T1w and T2w images respectively. 0 padding is used if any input channel is empty. The model would work on any single modality input (T1w/T2w) and have better performance when both modalities are provided.

prerequisite
--------
If T1w and T2w images are fed, two images must be aligned.


Usage
----------

There are two ways to use the module

1. import the isolate function in this SUITpy library (Recommended)
::
    from SUITPy import isolate

The function will return the predicted mask. There are also others arguments available. See the function references for details.

2. Alternatively, you can run the script directly via the terminal or CMD. This could be helpful if you need to use the function in a bash script.
::
    python isolate.py --T1 T1w_image

There are also other parameters available. Use the following command to see the details
::
    python isolate.py -help

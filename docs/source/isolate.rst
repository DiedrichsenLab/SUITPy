Isolation Module
================

The isolation module of the SUIT toolbox uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network to isolate the cerebellum and brainstem from the rest of the head. The network was trained on manually labelled anatomical images from a wide range of studies, scanners and acquisition protocols. The network is based on the U-Net architecture and implemented using the Pytorch package. The network was developed bt Yao Li with supervision from Carlos Hernandez-Castillo and JÃ¶rn Diedrichsen.

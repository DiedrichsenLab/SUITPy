Normalization Module
====================

The normalization module of the SUIT toolbox calculates a deformation field that maps the cerebellum of an individual subject to the SUIT template, using the mask generated by the isolation module. The Python-version uses the ANTSPy package to perform the normalization and will be released with version 2.1. The deformation field can then be used to reslice functional and anatomical data into SUIT space.

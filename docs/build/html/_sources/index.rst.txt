Welcome to SUITPy's documentation!
==================================
SUIT is a toolbox dedicated to the analysis of imaging data of the human cerebellum.
It is written to support a number of different analysis techniques, such as fMRI group analysis, lesion-symptom mapping, and VBM. 
All techniques share a number of initial similar steps, including the isolation of the cerebellum from the rest of the brain, normalization to the atlas template, and reslicing of the data into atlas space.
